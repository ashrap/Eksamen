      <h2>The interplay between technology and society</h2>
      <p>The internet is one of many infrastructures people use daily, and with the ground-breaking
        innovation, also came consequences. To highlight a positive political effect, the internet is a
        common platform available to everyone and the availability allows more people to reach out
        to the society and to be heard. However, due to algorithms, a consequence of the internet
        can be that a user is often exposed to content aligned with the users’ own opinions. As <a href="https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/publications/political-discourse-on-social-media-echo-chambers-gatekeepers-and">
        Garimella et al. (2018)</a> discuss, there is evidence supporting a so-called echo-chamber for
        contentious topics, which arguably politics can be.</p>
       <p>The echo-chamber can be defined as
        limiting the exposure to diverse perspectives and favor the formation of groups of
        like-minded users framing and reinforcing a shared narrative <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2023301118">(Cinelli et al., 2021)</a>. The
        echo-chamber raises an ethical question whether the internet can influence political choices
        and or behavior. If the left-wing only view left-wing videos, articles, comments, and news,
        among more, and the right-wing vice versa, the internet can contribute to political views and
        opinions on a subject. An example could be the comment section of an article. A user might
        be skeptical about his or her stance on a political subject but could get the impression that
        everyone agrees in the comments. This might incline the user to believe that more people
        agree than reality reflects.</p>
        <h2>The social responsibility of innovators</h2>
        <p>The social responsibility
          of innovators is important. We need to acknowledge what the inventions can do to society. It
          is also important to say how we want to firm the world, as discussed <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/responsible-innovation/what-responsible-innovation">“Responsible innovation
          urges us to reflect on what kind of world we want to live in and who should be involved in
          designing it.” </a>(Ucl. 2022). This statement is important as it needs to be reflected that
          inventing new things can go wrong; we need to think about how we want the world to be. A
          good example is the inventing of the nuclear bombs, how this inventing can kill the whole
          world fallen into the wrong hands. Social responsibility should be one of the main topics
          when inventing something new.</p>
